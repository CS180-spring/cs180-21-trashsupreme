## Running Instructions

We are using [Docker](https://docker.com) to run our code, to deal with dependencies.

In order to run the code, install Docker Desktop, then go to the home directory of the project (There should be a file called `docker-compose.yml`).

To build, run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

To run, run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
